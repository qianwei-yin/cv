  <h3>ACADEMIC THESES AND PUBLICATIONS</h3>
  <strong><a href="https://francis-press.com/papers/2492">Reduction of the Hedging Error in the Trinomial Tree Model</a></strong>
  <br>
  <strong>Position</strong>: First author
  <br>
  <strong>Abstract</strong>: The research problem is how large the replication error is if an investor
  Delta hedges a European option over many short periods. In the project, the trinomial stock price tree
  is firstly built to simulate stock price changes using Python. Then, Monte-Carlo approximation is used
  to put many short-period trinomial tree models together and derive the average hedging errors. The hedging
  errors become significantly smaller as periods involved in the trinomial tree models pass a certain number.
  This method can be used to create portfolios with European options.
